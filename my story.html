<h1>Visualisation of the current experiences </h1>

	<h1><strong>Part 1</strong></h1>
	<p>We all face different challenges everyday, In Man’s search for meaning,Viktor Frankl gives us hope by all the challenges he faced and overcame. Through  love,work and courage. In the real life today there are obstacles that come along.We can visualise in different ways. The first example is the corona challenge,people are so much,we don’t know what to do, our daily lives are complicated. We can overcome this if we love and help each other and this will help us to create a peaceful environment. <br>We can clarify what we want in life, this will force us to get serious about life, it will lead us and will help us to overcome and go through the challenges</p>

		<h1><strong>Part 2</strong></h1>
<p>The second way is to remove uncertainty,this will help get rid of the fears we have. In such a time we are worried and we have questions if we are going to overcome all these.We are afraid of visiting each other and travelling.This can sabotage our best efforts and prevent us from moving on. We can become familiar with such a situation by having meetings through zoom and having different and encouraging conversation with our friends and families.

	<div class="col-lg-4">
		<h1><strong>Part 3</strong></h1>
Another way is having the right emotions, positive energy and minds will help us overcome all this. Thinking of the bright future and not giving up on life. Spreading love and being grateful everyday will surely count and will help us to move.</p>

<h1>Structures we have inherited from colonial and western culture</h1>
</div>
<br>
<div class="col-lg-4">
<h2>Retrogressive</h2>
1.Patriarchal supremacy-We have inherited patriarchy systems from the colonial and western culture, in our daily lives men rule and women have no right to rule, they are not allowed to take part in society leadership and taking part in decision making. This is making the importance and the rights of women in the society depleted.
<br>
   2.discrimination- We have inherited dicrimination from the colonial system, we dont value each other and sometimes we aren’t willing to help each other and this leads to lack of unity and peace.
<br>
<br>
</div>


<div class="col-lg-4">
<h2>Progressive</h2>
1.Medicine- we have  inherited the trait of going to hospitals when we are sick rather than taking herbs and just staying at home. This has led to reduction of deaths in the society.
<br>
2.Christianty- We have inherited the fact that we believe in God rather than believing in witchdoctors and moons. This has led to increase in people who believe in God and spreading peace.
